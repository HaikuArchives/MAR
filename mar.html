MAR is a command line utility for the <a href="http://www.be.com">BeOS</a> platform.
MAR will read flattened message files, file attributes, or file resources and output
readable, editable XML.  MAR also has the capability of reading the XML output to write
a file's resources, attributes, and a flattened message file.  Curious about what all
those files contain in ~/config/settings, want to be able to manipulate them?  This tool
may be for you. Download <a href="http://www.tvl-p.com/data/mar.zip">the latest MAR</a> now!
For support for mar and the MAR library, please contact
<a href="mailto:mar@tvl-p.com">Todd Lair</a>.
<p>
It is important to remember that MAR has two modes of operation: Reading (specified with the
-r options) and Writing (specified with the -w options).  MAR has no default mode, so a -r or -w
must be specified.  Reading is for when you want to read binary data and output XML, where Writing
is for when you want to read XML and write binary data.  MAR's command line syntax is as follows:
<p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
To use MAR, it must be run from a command line prompt.  First you specify the command line options
then input file(s).  That is:<p>
<code>mar [options] [input file ...]</code><p>

<h3>Options</h3>
MAR's command line options are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Help</b><br>
		-h will display brief information regarding mar's usage.
  	<li><b>Reading</b><br>
		Reading mode is specified with the -r option, and takes
		an argument describing what part of the binary file you wish to read.
     	Output will be tagged XML like text.  If reading mode
      is specified, and the -o option is absent, output will be
      written to stdout.  The different read modes are as follows:
		<ul>
       	<li>-rm read input file as a flattened message and output XML.
       	<li>-ra read input file's attributes and ouput XML.
         <li>-rr read input file's resources and output XML.
		</ul>
		<p>	
		MAR does understand all basic types of element data, however, not
		all files contain basic types.  MAR's -s and -b options provide a
		means to handle these unsupported types.  Both -s and -b take a
		&lt;type&gt; argument.  This argument can be specified as either
		in the 4 letter code or numeric representation of the element data
		type.  MAR treats all &lt;type&gt; arguments numeric if the first
		character of the argument is a digit.
		<ul>
			<li>-s &lt;type&gt; Will treat &lt;type&gt; as a string type.  
			This option can be used with 'MIMS' and like element data types.
			<li>-b &lt;type&gt; Will treat &lt;type&gt; is a catch all and will
			simply treat the element data as binary data.  Not very easily editable.
		</ul>
		<p>
		When in reading mode, you can specify a -W option to specify the width of
		the raw element data streams.  Normally, the streams are outputed as 16 bytes
		per line, but a -W32 would make it 32 bytes per line.
	<li><b>Writing</b><br>
		Writing mode is specified with the -w option, and takes an argument
		describing how the output should be written.  The input is expected
		to be the XML type text that MAR outputs.  When using MAR's write
		mode, you must specify an -o option with the path for the file you
		wish to output to.  Also when in write mode and if no input files
		are specified on the command line, input is read from stdin.
		When writing attributes or resources, mar will first wipe out
		all attributes or resources, an then write the data elements parsed.
		The different write modes are as follows:

		<ul>
        	<li>-wm Write output as flattened message from XML input.
         <li>-wa Write output as attributes from XML input.
         <li>-wr Write output as resources from XML input.
		</ul>

	<li><b>General</b><br>
		The -o &lt;filename&gt; option allows you to specify which file the
		output will be written to.
</ul>

<h3>Programmers</h3>
If your a programmer and your asking yourself how can I read the XML output MAR produces
within my own programs, your in luck.  MAR was written with this in mind.  In fact,
the MAR command line utility uses the MAR library which you can also use to read the XML
text.  To use the MAR lib within your own programs, first compile the source in provided
in the <a href="http://www.tvl-p.com/data/mar.zip">mar archive</a>. This will produce
both mar and the libmar.a.  This libarary is what you want to link with when using the
mar's XML parsing routines.
<p>
Your interface to
the MAR library is contained within the marcontrol.h file, and should be the only header you
need to include in your program's source files.  Once the header file is included, all you
need to do is create an instance
of MarControl and call that object's Parse method.  If Parse returns MAR_OK, you can then call the
object's Message() function which will return a pointer to BMessage containing the data elements
the XML input parsed. 
<p>
Here is an example of using the MarControl class.

<pre><code>
#include "marcontrol.h"

...

   const char *file_list =
   {
      "/boot/home/config/settings/myprog/settings.xml",
      "/boot/home/config/settings/myprog/moresettings.xml"
   };

   MarControl marc (2, file_list);

   if (marc.Parse() != MAR_OK)
   {
      /* Parse didn't go well, uh oh */
      ...
   }

   BMessage settings, moresettings;
   BMessage *msg (marc.Message());

   if (msg-&gt;FindMessage (file_list[0], &amp;settings) == B_NO_ERROR)
   {
      /* do something with settings */
      ...
   }

   if (msg-&gt;FindMessage (file_list[1], &amp;moresettings) == B_NO_ERROR)
   {
      /* do something with moresettings */
      ...
   }

...

</code></pre>



The marcontrol.h header file declares the class MarControl and is
documented thusly:

<h4>
MarControl::MarControl (void)<br>
MarControl::MarControl (int32 num_files, const char **file_list)
</h4>
Constructs a MarControl instance.  If no parameters are passed to the constructor, the input is assumed
to be from stdin.  Otherwise, the <code>num_files</code> parameter specifies how many files you would
like to parse, and <code>file_list</code> is an array of character strings listing the file paths.  If passed
a file listing, the constructor makes its own a copy of the file names.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>If passed a file_list, the Message method when called will return a container message.
This message will contain a message for each each file parsed with the file name as the message's name.
<p>
<h4>virtual MarControl::~MarControl (void)</h4>
Deconstructor for the MarControl instance.
<p>

<h4>virtual int MarControl::ParseError (const char *text)</h4>
ParseError is called when the parser cannot proceed further either
due to syntax errors in the XML or parse internal errors.  ParseError will
print the line number the error occurred on, and a brief message as to why
things went wrong to stderr.<p>
If you choose to overide this method in a derivitive class, you may use the
two protected data elements error and errorstr.  error will be set to an
enumerated MarError defined in marcontrol.h.  It is possible that ParseError
is called, and error is still M_OK, and in this case a "General" error should
be assumed.  If error is not M_OK, errorstr should have a value describing the
error.
<p>


<h4>MarError MarControl::Parse (void)</h4>
This is what you call to get the ball rolling.  This parses either stdin or the file list
passed to the MarControl's constructor.  It will return a MarError indicating the success
of the parse.
<p>

<h4>BMessage	*MarControl::Message (void) const</h4>
Returns the results of the Parse method call.  The BMessage returned will be the XML's
representation in BMessage format.

<h4>int MarControl::LineNumber (void)</h4>
Returns the line number of where the parser is at.  Probably best called in derived
MarControl's ParseError methods.
